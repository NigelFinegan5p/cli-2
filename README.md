# JavaScript Calculator

HTML for Structure, CSS for style and Javascript for functionality

We started our project with HTML for structure. 
We created a basic  layout for our JavaScript Calculator in the Index.html file.

In the HTML structure, we have created a container for the JavaScript Calculator buttons for numbers, operators, and the clear and equal sign.

The HTML file starts with boilerplate html `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` element tag.

In the `<head>` section, we created meta tags for the character set and viewport settings, along with a title for the page <title>Calculator-Javascript</title>

A link to an external CSS file is included and written into the link by href="assets/css/style.css"

The `<body>` element, contains a `<div>` with the class “calculator” that contains all the calculator components, in total 20 input functions ( buttons ).

Inside the calculator `<div>`, there’s the text input “display”. This is where the output of the calculation result will display.

The rest of the calculator buttons are encased inside a number of other `<div>.`

## CSS Styling

To make our calculator visually appealing, we approached this by applying different CSS styles and effects.

To enhance the visual appeal of our calculator project with CSS. We applied styles to the buttons, display screen, and overall layout to make it user-friendly and appealing.

As the project has numbers theme we kept the background image in alignment with the theme the website.

With the addition of and the font family font-family: 'zen dots', amaranth. We set the background color to the entire body with styles to the container too. Using the color #f2c40f.
