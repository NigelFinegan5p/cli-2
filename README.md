# JavaScript Calculator

HTML Structure, CSS style, Javascript for functionality

We started our project with HTML for structure. 
We created a basic  layout for our JavaScript Calculator in the Index.html file.

In the HTML structure, we have created a container for the JavaScript Calculator buttons for numbers, operators, and the clear and equal sign.

The HTML file starts with boilerplate html `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` element tag.

In the `<head>` section, we created meta tags for the character set and viewport settings, along with a title for the page <title>Calculator-Javascript</title>

A link to an external CSS file is included and written into the link by href="assets/css/style.css"

The `<body>` element, contains a `<div>` with the class “calculator” that contains all the calculator components, in total 20 input functions ( buttons ).

Inside the calculator `<div>`, there’s the text input “display”. This is where the output of the calculation result will display.

The rest of the calculator buttons are encased inside a number of other `<div>.`
